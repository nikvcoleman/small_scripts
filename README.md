# small_scripts
### A repository to store simple Linux shell scripts for various purposes

1. **RHEL8** 
  - This is a collection of files and a script to be run from the root directory of a usb drive. It will take a RHEL8 fresh workstation install and install the nessecary components for a base image. This list and script will continue to grow as I find more things to add to it. 

2. **dd-rand-wipe.sh**
  - This script will list the current drives and let the user make a selection of what drive to overwrite with random data from /dev/urandom. It will then overwrite the drive seven times before exiting...I suggest running this from a live USB
